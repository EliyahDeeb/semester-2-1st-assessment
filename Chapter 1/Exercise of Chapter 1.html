    <br>
        <li> Spray the pan with cooking spray and cook the chicken in medium heat until it becomes golden brown, then remove the chicken from the pan. </li>
    <br>
        <li> Add the vegetables to the pan and stir for around 2-4 minutes in medium-low heat and once it is finished, 
            return the chicken to the pan and mix well. With that, the filling is prepared. </li>
