    <!-- The code below creates a webpage with a section for a "Petrol Calculator". 
        It includes spaces for entering the cost per liter of petrol and the number of liters you want to buy. 
        
        When you click the "Calculate Total Cost" button, it will show you the total cost of the petrol you want to purchase. 
        The initial values are set to $1.72 per liter and 0 liters, but you can change these values to calculate the total cost based on your own input.

        This code helps users quickly and easily determine how much they will spend on petrol based on the cost per liter and the amount of petrol they 
        want to purchase.-->
