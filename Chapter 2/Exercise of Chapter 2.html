    <h2> Overview </h2>

    <p> The series centers on Dante's goal of avenging his mother's murder by exterminating demons. 
        In the process, he encounters and is challenged by his twin brother, Vergil, who Dante thought was dead. 
        As the series progresses it is revealed that the demon emperor Mundus is responsible for the loss of Dante's mother and the corruption of his brother.

    <h2> Devil May Cry 3 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> The story of the series begins with Dante receiving missions from his liaison Enzo. 
        Enzo gives him a mission to locate a young girl named Alice. She eventually turns out to be possessed by a demon. 
        The demon would later reveal himself to be Arkham who was working with Vergil to unlock the seals of Temi-Ni-Gru. 
        Vergil and Dante meet and fight one another before Vergil reveals his plan to awaken the tower to the underworld and takes his leave with Arkham. </p>

    <h3> Dante's Awakening </h3>

    <p> In Devil May Cry 3 on Dante's as-of-yet unnamed shop as a mysterious man named Arkham appears to offer an invitation from Dante's brother, Vergil. 
        An immense tower erupts from the ground a short distance away from the shop and Dante takes the situation as a challenge. 
        Following numerous battles, Dante arrives at the tower's summit and encounters Vergil, who defeats Dante in combat and departs. 
        Dante eventually catches up with Vergil in the control room located in the tower's basement. 
        The brothers battle again until they are interrupted by Lady, then Arkham, who has been manipulating them all to reactivate the tower. 
        Arkham intends to steal the Force Edge, Sparda's sword.
        <br><br>
        Dante crosses over to the demon world and catches up with Arkham, and he and Vergil work together to bring down Arkham. 
        Dante and Vergil fight yet again, and Dante is victorious. 
        Returning to the human world, Dante meets Lady outside the tower where she coins the phrase "devil may cry" while trying to comfort Dante over the loss of his brother. 
        They form a friendship and the beginnings of a partnership in demon-slaying, and he names his shop "Devil May Cry". </p>

    <h2> Devil May Cry </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Devil May Cry begins with Dante being attacked in his office by Trish. 
        He brushes off her assault and she claims that the demon emperor Mundus is planning a return. 
        Dante explores Mallet Island, encountering a variety of powerful demons, including one named Nelo Angelo. 
        Dante is defeated by Nelo Angelo in combat, but Nelo Angelo flees at the sight of Dante's half of the Perfect Amulet. 
        Other encounters with Mundus's demon generals serve to indicate that Dante has become even more powerful than his father since his initial awakening. 
        Nelo Angelo attacks twice more in later missions, and is eventually revealed to be Dante's twin brother, Vergil. 
        Dante enters the underworld in pursuit of Mundus, where Trish sacrifices herself to save him. 
        Dante uses the emotions triggered by Trish's actions to release the power of Sparda that Vergil sought in Devil May Cry 3. 
        Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence. Trish returns and lends Dante her power. Dante then defeats Mundus. 
        Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses, and later work together in the renamed shop, "Devil Never Cry", although the name was reverted later.</p>

    <h2> Devil May Cry 2 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Devil May Cry 2 begins with Dante entering a museum where an important item called the Medaglia is stored. 
        There, also, Lucia invites Dante to the distant island of Vie de Marli. 
        Lucia's mother, Matier, asks Dante to help fight Arius, a businessman who wields demonic power. 
        Dante decides to help. Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that she was his creation. 
        Shortly afterwards, Lucia gives Dante the last of the Arcana before leaving. 
        Dante then encounters Matier again and she asks Dante to take the Arcana to save Lucia. 
        Lucia attacks Arius, though he captures her. Dante arrives and trades the Arcana for Lucia, then attacks Arius, who escapes. 
        A large stream of energy strikes the Uroburos tower and a portal to the demon world is opened. 
        Dante and Lucia argue over who will enter, but ultimately it is Dante who enters the portal to deal with Argosax. 
    <br><br>
    After Dante departs, Arius returns, though Lucia goes on to defeat him. Within the portal, Dante fights and defeats the partially summoned Argosax. 
    Finding the portal closed, Dante instead drives further into the demon realm on a motorcycle. 
    In the aftermath of the battle, Matier insists to Lucia that Sparda returned from a similar trip. 
    Sometime later, in Dante's shop, Lucia muses about Dante. Outside, the sound of a motorcycle echoes, and Lucia leaves to investigate. 
    The player is not shown whether or not it is Dante (it is most likely Dante). </p>

    <h2> Devil May Cry 4 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> In Devil May Cry 4, Lady calls upon Dante to investigate the Order of the Sword, a cult-like group that worships Sparda and has been collecting Devil Arms. 
        Dante is originally uninterested, but Trish goes on ahead and takes the Sparda sword with her. 
        Later, Nero witnesses Dante assassinate the Order's leader, Sanctus. 
        Nero attacks Dante and unleashes his Devil Bringer arm, only to find that Dante was not taking their fight seriously. 
        Nero pursues Dante, and along the way comes to realize that the Order is opening gates to the demon world in order to harness its power. 
        After a battle against Agnus, Nero discovers and magically restores the Yamato, which the Order had found broken in several places. 
        Sanctus is revived through demonic power, and he sets in motion a plan to capture Nero by kidnapping Kyrie, Nero's love interest. 
        Nero pursues and fights Sanctus, but is ultimately captured and used to form the core of The Savior, a giant demon in the form of a god. 
        Dante steps in and destroys all the Hell Gates that the Order has opened, then fights against the Savior. 
        Unable to destroy it from the outside, he leaves that task to Nero to defeat it from the inside. 
        While inside the Savior, Nero kills Sanctus and rescues Kyrie, and ultimately destroys the Savior. 
        Dante entrusts Yamato, which formerly belonged to Vergil, to Nero, and leaves with Trish. 
        Later, at the Devil May Cry shop, Lady pays Dante and Trish for their work. 
        Then, a customer with the password phones in, and the three head out to take on another mission.</p>

    <h2> Devil May Cry 5 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Devil May Cry 5 is a set a few years after the events of Devil May Cry 4 and the Deadly Fortune novel, with Nero having his own branch of the Devil May Cry shop now. 
        An unknown figure rips off Nero's Devil Bringer out of his arm and a Demon Tree sprouts inside the Red Grave City, 
        which leads him on a quest to fend off the demons from the city with the help of his new friend, Nico, 
        who also built him a prosthetic arm called the Devil Breaker. 
        Meanwhile J.D. Morrison brought Dante a new client, a man known as V, who wants to hire Dante in order to stop a powerful demon that is about to resurrect. 
        Dante accepts the job and sets out to the Red Grave City with Lady and Trish.</p>

    <h2> Protagonists </h2> 

    <hr>    

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <h4> Dante </h4> </li>
            <p> Dante, the series' primary protagonist, 
                is a mercenary specializing in the paranormal and the main playable character in the first three Devil May Cry games.
                He is one of the twin sons of Sparda, a demon knight who sided with humanity and drove back an invasion of the human world by demons about 2,000 years before the series' events.
                The character was voiced by Drew Coombs in the original Devil May Cry and Matthew Kaminsky in Devil May Cry 2. 
                Reuben Langdon voiced Dante in all subsequent appearances.</p>

            <li> <h4> Nero </h4></li>
            <p>Nero is the secondary protagonist of the franchise, introduced in Devil May Cry 4. 
                An orphan adopted by the Sparda-worshipping Order of the Sword, Nero grew up to become a Holy Knight of the Order. 
                He does not get along well with others and prefers to work alone, so he is usually given the Order's "special assignments". 
                He is the son of Vergil, which also makes him the nephew of Dante and the grandson of Sparda. 
                The character is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Nero returns as one of the primary protagonists in Devil May Cry 5.</p>

            <li> <h4> Lucia </h4> </li>
            <p> Lucia, along with Dante, is one of the two protagonists in Devil May Cry 2. 
                An agile fighter, she uses two ornately carved curved daggers. 
                Like Dante, she can Devil Trigger (transform into a "harpy", a birdlike demon of light). 
                Character designer Daigo Ikeno stated that the team aimed for a contrast between Lucia and Trish, 
                making them look as though they were from different races. 
                Lucia is a member of Protectorate, a clan of guardians in the Vie de Marli with the blood of devils. 
                She invites Dante to her island so her adoptive mother, Matier, can ask him to help them defeat Arius 
                (a man who has turned their land into a devils' paradise). Dante accepts, and he and Lucia begin their quests. 
                The player later learns that Lucia is actually Chi, a devil bred by Arius but abandoned as defective. 
                When she reaches Arius, Dante has already defeated him and rides his motorcycle to the demon world to stop an ancient demon. 
                After Dante leaves, Arius (now a monster) rises from the ruins and attacks Lucia; she defeats him, and awaits Dante's return. 
                Lucia is voiced by Françoise Gralewski. </p>

            <li> <h4> V </h4> </li>
            <p> V is one of the protagonists of Devil May Cry 5, a mysterious figure who hires Dante to come with him to Red Grave City to subdue Urizen.
                He is ultimately revealed to be the discarded humanity of Vergil seeking to merge back with Urizen to their original form.
                In battle, V uses three demon familiars created from trace memories of Nelo Angelo to weaken his opponents so he can land the deathblow. 
                Following Vergil's restoration, now fully independent beings, the hawk-like Griffon leads the panther-like Shadow and the golem Nightmare to attack Dante of their own free will, and all three die fighting him. 
                V is motion captured by Owen Hamze and voiced by Brian Hanford in English.</p>

    <h2> Antagonists </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <h4> Vergil </h4> </li>
            <p> Dante's older identical twin brother, Vergil embraces his demonic side and is obsessed with gaining power. 
                He is the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry 3 and a playable character in the game's special edition, 
                ending up as Mundus's servant Nelo Angelo in the first Devil May Cry game.
                While appearing in Devil May Cry 4 and playable in its special edition to hint at his relation to Nero, 
                fragments of Nelo Angelo's form were used as the basis for the Angelo-type demons developed by Agnus for Sanctus's use. 
                Vergil returns in Devil May Cry 5 where he is revealed to be Nero's father while stealing the Yamato back for his use. 
                Later, Dante's and Vergil's rivalry is a friendly one. Vergil also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game, 
                Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. In English, Vergil is voiced by Daniel Southworth; Nelo Angelo is voiced by David Kelley in Devil May Cry.</p>

            <li> <h4> Mundus </h4> </li>
            <p> Mundus is the Emperor of the Underworld and the overarching antagonist of the series, 
                starting with his role as the main antagonist of the original Devil May Cry. 
                He is portrayed as a semi-amorphous creature with three orb-like eyes who takes the form of a white-skinned seraph with a third eye on his forehead and a scar on his chest.
                Millennia ago, Mundus led the demons under his command in a long and brutal war with humanity, 
                until he was betrayed and defeated by the strongest of his knights, Sparda, who sealed his powers and imprisoned him in his own realm. 
                After Sparda's death due to the loss of his immortality, Mundus took revenge by sending his minions to murder Dante's mother, Eva, 
                and seemingly killing his brother Vergil as well. 
                In the aftermath of Devil May Cry 3, Mundus captured Vergil when he challenged him and turned the young man into the first of the Angelo demons.
                As the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry, Mundus is shown to have spent centuries posing as a statue on the forbidding Mallet Island, 
                steadily corrupting the inhabitants and using his powers to remake the island in his own image. 
                He then crafts a demon named Trish, making her look identical to Eva, and sending her to hire Dante to kill him so he can be destroyed. 
                Mundus carefully monitored Dante's progress throughout the island, watching as he defeated his servants one by one and even stepping in to personally murder his servant Griffon when he begs Mundus for more power. 
                Finally, when even Trish proved unable to stop Dante, Mundus tried to strike him down with his magic, but Trish took the attack instead, 
                leaving her close to death. Dante's anger transformed him into the form of his father Sparda, and he defeated Mundus in personal combat. 
                Despite this, Mundus crossed over, and tried to crush Dante with his decomposing body. Trish then combined her own magic with Dante's weapons, allowing him to seal Mundus' powers once again. 
                Before he was banished back to his realm, Mundus vowed to one day take his revenge on Dante and conquer all of the human world. </p>

            <li> <h4> Arius </h4> </li>
            <p> Arius, the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry 2, is an insane, wealthy businessman who owns an international company, Uroboros.
                He wants to find the legendary Arcana, artifacts which would allow him to raise Argosax from the demonic realm and use his power to control the world.
                Human at the beginning of the game, Arius has access to powerful magic (which enables him to fight demon hunters like Dante) and can create his own demons.
                Near the end of the game, in Lucia's scenario, Arius survives his battle with Dante. 
                Infused with the power of Argosax, he attacks Lucia (first as a demonic version of himself). As he begins to lose, he mutates into a giant creature.</p>

            <li> <h4> Argosax the Chaos </h4> </li>
            <p> Argosax the Chaos was a cruel demonic deity who once rivaled Mundus and was the final antagonist of Devil May Cry 2. 
                Like his sovereign, Argosax was imprisoned in the void of the Underworld by Sparda when the rebellious knight came 
                to the aide of the clan of Dumary Island. Using the Arcanas—sacred relics used to exorcise Argosax centuries prior—Arius intended to absorb 
                the demon's power to achieve apotheosis. Instead, as Dante had switched the Medaglia coin with his own, the ritual was incomplete and caused 
                Arius to become possessed upon dying.

                Despite its faulty execution, the ritual was sufficient enough to create a portal to the devil's prison—enough to enable Argosax to escape 
                if given time. Seeking to put an end to this scheme, Dante elects to enter the gateway and face the demon deity like his father before him. 
                When he first appears, his native form—the Despair Embodied, a fiery horned hermaphrodite with angelic wings—is gestating inside of a chrysalis 
                composed of the reanimated corpses of assorted bosses from games 1 and 2. He's capable of channeling their power while in this form. </p>

            <li> <h4> Arkham </h4> </li>
            <p> Arkham is the secondary antagonist in Devil May Cry 3, which takes place before the events of the first Devil May Cry game, 
                and the estranged father of Lady. In the game, he is a scholar in the demonology and the supernatural who sought to break the seal Sparda made 
                to prevent Temen-ni-gru tower from serving as a Hell Gate. Arkham also desired to become a demon. A failed attempt by sacrificing his wife 
                Kalina Ann resulted in the left side of his face being scarred but gave him some power. Arkham tricks Vergil into helping him while assuming 
                the guise of the lunatic Jester (ジェスター, Jesutā) to lead Dante through Temen-ni-gru. He plays the brothers against each other along with 
                exploiting Lady's attempts to avenge her mother, to bring all the factors of unsealing Temen-ni-gru into place. Arkham then travels 
                through the completed gate to retrieves the Force Edge, combining its power with the restored halves of Eva's amulet to absorb Sparda's power. 
                Though he becomes a demon resembling Sparda, Arkham's body is unable to compensate for the power as he mutates into an amorphous abomination 
                that Dante and Vergil defeat together. Arkham is reverted to his original state as he ends up back in the human world where Lady kills him.</p>

            <li> <h4> Sanctus </h4> </li>
            <p> Sanctus is the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry 4. The proclaimed Vicar of Sparda and general of the Holy Knights, 
                he is regarded as one of the greatest spiritual leaders of the Order of the Sword. Sanctus was apparently killed by Dante at the beginning of the game, 
                but in reality, Sanctus survived as he had himself infused with demonic essence in an ascension ceremony. Sanctus originally planned to use Dante to give 
                life to the Savior, a colossus in Sparda's image housing collected demon essence. But he decides to use Nero after his righthand, Angus, revealed the truth 
                of the Order's actions. Sanctus takes matters into his own hands by having Agnus kidnap Kyrie to have the Savior absorb her so it can assimilate Nero. 
                Sanctus than uses the Yamato to open the artificial Hellgates before merging into Savior to commence his plan to wipe out all demons and rule the world while
                projecting himself through an animated suit of armor. Dante manages to sabotage Sanctus's scheme before freeing Nero to rescue Kyrie while defeating a 
                mental construct of Sanctus, Nero. He completely destroys him by using the Devil Bringer on the Savior. The character is voiced by Liam O'Brien in English 
                with O'Brien also doing the motion capture for Sanctus. Yoshikawa designed him
                to become intimidating across the storyline.</p>

            <li> <h4> Agnus </h4> </li>
            <p> Agnus is the Order of Sparda's chief technology researcher and alchemist in Devil May Cry 4, developing demon-killing weapons for the Knights. 
                An introverted workaholic with a habit of stuttering when stressed, Agnus rarely appears outside his office and very few in the cult know about
                him. It is later learned that he has been experimenting with the broken Yamato and created demon-based weapons like the Angelos, even turning himself
                into the insect-like Agnus Angelo before being killed by Dante when he attempts to keep him from the Yamato. He is indirectly mentioned with contempt 
                by his surviving daughter Nico in Devil May Cry 5. The character is voiced by T. J. Storm in English. </p>

            <li> <h4> Urizen </h4> </li>
            <p> Urizen, the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry 5, is the demonic half of Vergil that came into being when Vergil used the Yamato to purge his humanity 
                to become a full Demon. Urizen proceeds to plant a Qliphoth Tree in Red Grave City so he can acquire its fruit to become the undisputed ruler of the 
                Underworld, only to be defeated by Dante and absorbed by his other half V. Urizen is voiced by Daniel Southworth in the English. 
                Urizen was meant to remind players of Mundus, the original Demon King from the 2001 Devil May Cry game. Itsuno said, 
                "Urizen is definitely the strongest enemy of the entire Devil May Cry saga ... the most powerful. You've seen it: every time he appears, 
                he sits on his throne and, maybe sometimes, he moves a little, but that's it. We want to make people understand how a fight against him can be completely 
                crazy."</p>

    <h2> Supporting Characters </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <li> <h4> Trish </h4></li>
        <p> Trish is a demon created by Mundus who strangely resembles Dante's mother, Eva. 
            She has enhanced strength and agility, accelerated healing and the ability to use lightning. 
            In English, Trish is voiced by Sarah Lafleur in Devil May Cry. </p>

        <li> <h4> Lady </h4></li>
        <p> Lady is a freelance demon hunter. A human, she is skilled in acrobatics and armed close quarters combat. 
            Lady has black hair, eyes of different colors and a signature weapon, the Kalina-Ann (a customized missile launcher). 
            When fighting, she uses a CZ75 pistol with a compensator and a VZ61 submachine gun with a bayonet attached to it. 
            She was named Mary by her father, Arkham, but she renounced the name when he murdered her mother in a ritual to obtain demonic power, 
            an act which drove Mary to psychosis and obsessive vengeance. Lady first appears in Devil May Cry 3,
            when she refuses to identify herself to Dante; he replies, "Whatever, lady!" Lady formalizes her name in the game's denouement when she shoots 
            Arkham, telling him that "Mary" is dead. Although she is not a villain, her role in Devil May Cry 3 is that of an antagonist, 
            as she seeks to deter Dante and even fights him twice before finally coming to terms with him.</p>

        <li> <h4> Sparda </h4></li>
        <p> Sparda is the demonic knight who rebelled for humanity's sake 2,000 years before the events of Vergil's Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition. He defeated many demons and their emperor, Mundus, before sealing the gateway between the demonic and human worlds. Sparda's heroism made him legendary in the human world, and he is known as "the Legendary Dark Knight".
            <br>
            In Devil May Cry and its successors, Sparda left his power in his sword (known as the Force Edge or the Sparda) in the demonic realm. ("Sparda" is the Japanese inflection for "spada", a Latin word for "sword".) To seal the gateway between the worlds Sparda sacrificed his blood and that of a mortal priestess, using two complementary amulets as a key which he brought into the human world. To work, the amulets must be joined. Near the end of his life Sparda took a human wife (Eva) and fathered twin sons (Dante and Vergil). He gave the amulets to Eva, who passed them on to their sons. Sparda also gave his sons enchanted swords with opposing powers: Dante's broadsword Rebellion that allows the user to absorb anything, and Vergil's katana Yamato that can split one's being or open a link to the Demon World. It is unknown how Sparda died, and Dante believed that there was a lot of confusion surrounding his father and his legacy. </p>

        <li> <h4> Eva </h4></li>
        <p> Eva is Sparda's human wife and the mother of Dante and Vergil, giving her sons each half of Sparda's amulet as a birthday gift. Eva was murdered in her home in Red Grave City by demons sent by Mundus. She safely hid Dante away, but was killed while she was looking for Vergil. Mundus later created Trish with Eva's appearance in a failed attempt to lure Dante to his death. In Devil May Cry 5, like Trish, Eva is voiced by Wendee Lee in English. </p>

        <li> <h4> J.D Morrison </h4></li>
        <p> Morrison is Dante's closest friend and broker. He finds Dante jobs, acts as a handyman to keep Devil May Cry functioning, and offers him advice on how to be a better person. Morrison returns in Devil May Cry 5, having been heavily redesigned from his previous appearance. Following the game's events, Morrison becomes the new owner of the Devil May Cry office. In English, Morrison is voiced by Joey Camen in Devil May Cry 5.</p>
        
        <li> <h4> Matier </h4></li>
        <p> Matier, a supporting character in Devil May Cry 2, is an old woman and (like Lucia) part of the Protectorate clan. When she was younger, she and her clan fought the demons with Sparda. Matier is cheerful and optimistic, certain of Dante's eventual victory. She guides Lucia to reunite the Arcanas (mystical relics) and lure Dante (whom she calls "Son of Sparda") to their island. Although it is first claimed that Matier is Lucia's mother, it is later revealed that Lucia was created by Arius (who planned to dispose of her when Matier found and raised her). The character is voiced by Flo DiRe. </p>
        
        <li> <h4> Credo </h4></li>
        <p> Credo, captain of hundreds of Holy Knights, is a strict, just man who is admired for his prowess on the battlefield. Kyrie's older brother, he sees Nero as family, but finds him unreliable. He was designed with key motifs representing his job, which Yoshikawa found fun to create. He orders Nero to capture Dante for Sanctus' "assassination", but is part of Sanctus' plan to bring about the Order's "Savior". Credo tries to arrest Nero after he learns about the latter's demonic power, and transforms into a winged creature he believes is angelic. When Kyrie is kidnapped to be used by the Order for Sanctus's grand plan, Credo loses his faith in the Order for using his sister as a tool and tries to help Nero save her. He is mortally wounded by Sanctus while trying to save Nero from capture, and Nero is absorbed into the Savior. Dying, Credo asks Dante to save Nero and Kyrie as his body dissipates into light. He is voiced by TJ Rotolo in English. His devil form was meant to contrast Nero's and Dante's due to how he looks like a heroic person when he still looks like a demon. </p>
        
        <li> <h4> Kyrie </h4></li>
        <p> Kyrie is a supporting character introduced in Devil May Cry 4. She was born and raised in Fortuna and works as a singer for the Order of the Sword. She is Credo's sister, and Nero's childhood friend and love interest. After being misled into thinking that Nero is evil, Kyrie was held hostage by Agnus under orders of Sanctus to lure Nero to the Savior. He arrives too late however, as she had already fused with the Savior. Her fusion causes Credo to defect from the Order after recognizing Santus' evil scheme. When Dante frees Nero from captivity in the Savior, Nero can free Kyrie as she begins her new life with him. She makes two off-screen cameos in Devil May Cry 5, the first when Nero lost the Devil Bringer and the second in renewing his resolve to end the animosity between Dante and Vergil. The character is voiced by Stephanie Sheh in the English versions</p>
        
        <li> <h4> Nicoletta "Nico" Goldstein </h4></li>
        <p> Nicoletta Goldstein, nicknamed Nico, is a weapons designer introduced in Devil May Cry 5 who acts as Nero's tech support. She is the daughter of Agnus, whom she speaks of with great disdain, and the granddaughter of Nell Goldstein, the gunsmith proprietor of ".45 Caliber Works" who made Dante's signature handguns, "Ebony & Ivory". She considers her weapons works of art, having developed Nero's Devil Breaker prosthetic arms. Nico is motion-captured and voiced by Faye Kingslee in English. Nico was created to be a contrasting heroine to Nero's girlfriend, Kyrie; Nico is more used to fighting. </p>
